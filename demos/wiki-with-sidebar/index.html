                    <p>
                        Jack Simmons was a member of London-based deathcore act 
                        Acrania, while Alex Terrible had gained a cult following 
                        online for his vocal covers on YouTube. Terrible was 
                        also a member of the Russian deathcore act We Are 
                        Obscurity, which disbanded after failing to find a 
                        record label. Former We Are Obscurity members Maxim 
                        Zadorin (guitar) and drummer Anton Poddyachy (drums) 
                        later became part of the initial lineup of Slaughter to 
                        Prevail, along with Slava Antonenko (guitar) and Filipp 
                        Kucheryavyh (bass). Zadorin left the band very early on 
                        and was replaced by his former We Are Obscurity bandmate 
                        Dimmitry Mamedov.

                        Slaughter to Prevail released an EP titled Chapters of 
                        Misery in 2015. The EP's underground success led to them 
                        being signed to Sumerian Records in 2016. Chapters of 
                        Misery was re-released under Sumerian Records in 2016. 
                        The re-release included a new song called "As the 
                        Vultures Circle". In May 2016, it was announced that 
                        Slaughter to Prevail would be joining bands such as 
                        Cannibal Corpse for Summer Slaughter 2016. Dimitry 
                        Mamedov left the band before Sumerian Records signed 
                        them, and was replaced by Simmons' former bandmate in 
                        Acrania Sam Baker. Baker only stayed in the band for a 
                        year, however, and after his departure the band scaled 
                        down to only having two guitar players. Original bassist 
                        Filipp Kucheryavyh also left the band a year later and 
                        was replaced by former My Autumn bassist Mikhail Petrov.

                        The band released their first full-length album, Misery 
                        Sermon, in 2017. According to the band, Misery Sermon 
                        was inspired by the hate and misery within themselves 
                        and around them. Slaughter to Prevail was once again 
                        invited to perform at Summer Slaughter 2017 alongside 
                        bands such as The Black Dahlia Murder and Dying Fetus 
                        but was ultimately unable to make the tour due to visa 
                        issues. Slaughter to Prevail was also invited to join 
                        Suicide Silence on their 10th anniversary tour of their 
                        album The Cleansing and was set to perform in the USA 
                        and Canada in November and December 2017. However, the 
                        band encountered visa issues due to the American visa 
                        freeze for Russians. During the Misery Sermon cycle, 
                        Jack Simmons began a hiatus from touring with the band. 
                        He would carry on as a studio-only member, with The 
                        Hopewell Furnace guitarist Jared Delgado taking his 
                        place on stage.

                        In 2018, Whitechapel invited Slaughter to Prevail to 
                        join their Ten Years of Exile tour alongside Chelsea 
                        Grin and Oceano. Jared Delgado stopped working with the 
                        band during this period, being replaced by So This Is 
                        Suffering guitarist Robert Brown. Original drummer Anton 
                        Poddyachy also decided to leave the band in 2018, being 
                        replaced by Katalepsy drummer Evgeny Novikov. The band 
                        released the singles "Agony" and "Demolisher" in 2019 
                        and 2020, respectively, to widespread popularity, with 
                        Metal Injection saying "The release of 'Demolisher' was 
                        an event in the deathcore community. Countless Youtube 
                        reaction videos lauded the impossibly deep growls and 
                        brutal instrumentation." Jack Simmons also decided to 
                        come out of his hiatus, taking part in the public-facing 
                        activities of the band for the first time since 2017. 
                        In 2021, the band released another single, "Baba Yaga," 
                        named after a being from Slavic folklore. The song 
                        elected by Loudwire as the third best metal song of 
                        2021. The band released another single, "Zavali Ebalo." 
                        Their second full-length album, Kostolom, was released 
                        on August 13, 2021, and included the four singles. 
                        Former guitarist Dimitry Mamedov also returned to the 
                        band during this time. In an interview on November 30th, 
                        Terrible expressed dissatisfaction with the band's deal 
                        to Sumerian Records, attributing it to being "in a 
                        without legal advisors. He said the band would likely 
                        sue to terminate their contract and continue 
                        independently, but "the issue is pending right now." 
                        Ultimately, the band decided to stay with Sumerian 
                        Records. On February 26, 2022, the band released a 
                        statement on Facebook condemning the Russian invasion of 
                        Ukraine which began two days earlier. Terrible issued 
                        another statement on behalf of the band via Instagram 
                        and Youtube on March 1, also urging viewers to "not make 
                        the whole Russian people an accomplice." On August 9, 
                        the band released the song "1984," inspired by the 
                        George Orwell novel, in protest of the government and 
                        the war. The band relocated to Orlando, Florida three 
                        months prior due to the effects of the war and previous 
                        suppression by the Russian government, as well as an 
                        interest in the Florida's death metal scene. On July 28, 
                        2023, the band released a new single, called “Viking.” 
                        On February 28, 2024, they released a new single called 
                        “Conflict.” On May 24, 2024, they released a new single 
                        called "Kid Of Darkness".

                    <p>
                        Slaughter to Prevail has been described mainly as 
                        deathcore, with a major focus on Terrible's 
                        extremely deep guttural vocals. Terrible has 
                        mentioned that the band has been influenced by other 
                        prominent deathcore bands such as Suicide Silence, 
                        Bring Me the Horizon, and Carnifex. Kostolom marked 
                        a stylistic shift, with reviewers noting influence 
                        from nu metal such as Slipknot's Iowa. Terrible also 
                        started varying his vocal style more on Kostolom, 
                        incorporating pitched screams and occasional clean 
                        vocals alongside the growls and gutturals he was 
                        known for. Slaughter to Prevail's lyrics are written 
                        in both Russian and English, with both languages 
                        often appearing in the same song.

                    <p>
                        Alex Terrible has been accused multiple times of being 
                        part of the alt-right movement. Specifically, he has 
                        been accused of promoting Nazi ideology, transphobia, 
                        and animal cruelty. He has used symbols and imagery 
                        that are associated with Nazism in the past, such as the 
                        Black Sun (which he had a prominent tattoo of on his 
                        arm) and the Othala rune. He has also previously had 
                        associations with and promoted neo-Nazi groups, brands 
                        and artists on social media. The band denied these 
                        allegations, stating that they're against any form of 
                        extremism. Terrible also had his black sun tattoo 
                        covered up, both as a response to the accusations and to 
                        the Christchurch mosque shootings. Terrible addressed 
                        the neo-Nazi accusations and the tattoo when he appeared 
                        on the No Jumper podcast in 2024.
