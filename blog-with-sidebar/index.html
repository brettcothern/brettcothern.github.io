                <h1>Mobapad M6 HD Joy-Cons make the Nintendo Switch even better 
                    – Review</h1>
                <h5>by Wolf’s Gaming Blog - June 14, 2024</h5>
                <p>
                    Like many people, I find the standard Joy-Cons difficult to 
                    use as their small size cramps my hands. I’ve tried a few 
                    alternatives but most of them always came with major 
                    downsides, such as weak rumble or no gyro controls, and 
                    eventually settled on some Skull & Co grips that make 
                    playing in handheld far better, but doesn’t solve the issues 
                    I had with the cramped face buttons buttons. That’s where 
                    Chinese manufacturer Mobapad comes into the picture. You 
                    might recall the name from earlier this year when they 
                    published information about the next generation Nintendo 
                    console. I followed up with them at the time, attempting to 
                    verify their claims and figure out how they had come by the 
                    information. You can read about that here. After the article 
                    went live, they asked if I wanted to check out one of their 
                    products, the M6 HD, a set of replacement Joy-Cons. On 
                    paper, they seem offer everything: chunky grips, hall effect 
                    sticks, mechanical buttons, rumble, Amiibo support, gyro 
                    controls and more.

                    It almost seems too good to be true, but to my surprise, the 
                    M6 HD delivers on nearly every front. It has a couple of 
                    issues and obviously the ergonomics won’t work for 
                    absolutely everyone, but overall these are among the very 
                    best Joy-Con replacements available. Grabbing both 
                    controllers from the box reveals two things: these are 
                    considerably bigger than the regular Joy-Cons, and they are 
                    quite a bit heavier, too. At 90g they’d be fighting in a 
                    different weight category, for sure. It doesn’t make Switch 
                    heavy, by any means, but it’s still a substantial increase 
                    and something to keep in mind if you already find your arms 
                    tiring from holding the console aloft. The extra weight 
                    combined with the build quality help to make the M6 HDs feel 
                    like a quality product. There’s zero give in the lightly 
                    textured plastic shells and creaking when you squeeze. They 
                    are also a very tight fit into the Switch’s rails, giving 
                    them a great sense of security. Unlike the standard Joy-Cons 
                    which creak and bend a little when slotted in place, the M6 
                    HDs are solid. I feel safe holding the weight of the Switch 
                    in just one M6 HD, something which I don’t feel safe doing 
                    when using the regular Joy-Cons The downside, of course, is 
                    that the M6 HDs are a little stiffer to slide in and out 
                    which could be a mild headache if don’t leave them in 
                    permanently.

                    It goes without saying that initial impressions cannot 
                    replace long-term testing to determine if the M6 HD will 
                    hold up to everyday usage. A quick browse of Reddit suggests 
                    people are happy with the Joy-Con’s durability, aside from a 
                    slight discolouring of the sticks. I’ll update this review 
                    if I encounter any issues in the future with them. In terms 
                    of comfort, the difference between the M6 HDs and the 
                    regular Joy-Cons is like the difference between a cheap cut 
                    of beef and a really nice ribeye steak – sure, the first one 
                    will get the job done, but ribeye hits different, man. 
                    Bigger and bulkier, the M6 HDs make the Switch feel like a 
                    different machine in handheld mode The rear has nice chunky 
                    grips that sink nicely into your palms and all the buttons 
                    have room to breath unlike the super-cramped layout of the 
                    Nintendo Joy-Cons. Even the triggers feel super-sized, 
                    dwarfing even those of the Xbox Series controllers.
