            <h5>INGREDIENTS</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound Cavatappi pasta</li>
                <li>1/4 cup salt, plus a pinch</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
                <li>12 cloves of garlic, chopped</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
                <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, minced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon fresh thyme, minced</li>
                <li>2 1/2 cups half & half</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
                <li>2 cups cheddar cheese, shredded*</li>
                <li>4 cups smoked Gouda cheese, shredded*</li>
            </ul>
            <p>*For best results, buy blocks of cheese and shred them 
                yourself. Pre-shredded cheese is often coated to prevent 
                sticking and doesn’t melt as well, which may result in a 
                grainy sauce.

            <h5>DIRECTIONS</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees and boil a large pot of 
                    water. Once water is boiling, put in the pasta along 
                    with 1/4 cup of salt. Cook the pasta until al dente, 
                    approximately 9 minutes. Strain in a colander and 
                    set aside. In a large saucepan on medium-high heat, 
                    melt the butter and add the olive oil. Let the 
                    butter bubble for a minute or so, then reduce heat 
                    to medium, add the chopped garlic, onion powder, 
                    mustard powder, and stir. Let cook for a minute 
                    until fragrant.
                </li>
                <li>Season with salt and pepper, and add the herbs. 
                    Immediately add the half & half and heavy cream.
                    Stir to combine all ingredients and turn heat up to 
                    medium-high. Allow to cook for 3-4 minutes before 
                    adding all the cheddar cheese and half of the smoked 
                    Gouda. Stir every few minutes until the sauce is 
                    boiling and the cheese has melted. When the sauce 
                    comes to a boil, lower the heat and add the cooked 
                    pasta to saucepan. Stir to fully coat the pasta.
                    Pour the pasta and cheese sauce in a 3 inch deep 
                    9”x13” baking dish and top with the remaining smoked 
                    Gouda. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes 
                    uncovered, then broil on high for a few minutes 
                    until the top of the dish is brown and crispy.
                    Remove from the over, and let sit 5 minutes before 
                    serving.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ul><b>Optional addition:</b>
                <li>Chop a half a pound of cooked bacon and add to the 
                    cheese sauce before adding the pasta.</li>
